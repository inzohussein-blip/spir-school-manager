/**
 * Lab database sync — what the stations and the lab's own database exchange.
 *
 * Every device keeps working on its own copy (IndexedDB, no internet needed). When the lab has a
 * database of its own, each device sends what it changed and receives what the other devices
 * changed, one record at a time (a visit, a patient, a test…). When two devices changed the same
 * record, the later change wins. Only text travels: images kept in a record (a data URL, such as
 * an uploaded logo) stay on the device that has them.
 *
 * The database is the lab's, not the site's: Supabase (the device talks to it directly with the
 * project's URL, anon key and a user of the lab), or any PostgreSQL (through this site's server,
 * with a connection string kept encrypted on the server — the device never sees it).
